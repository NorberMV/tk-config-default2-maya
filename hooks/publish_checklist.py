        The method returns an dictionary, where the key is the name of a
        setting that should be updated and the value is the new value of that
        setting. Note that it is not necessary to return all the values from
        the UI. This is to allow the publisher to update a subset of settings
        when multiple tasks have been selected.

        `create_settings_widget`.

        A list of settings dictionaries are supplied representing the current
        values of the settings for selected tasks. The settings dictionaries
        correspond to the dictionaries returned by the settings property of the
        hook.

        Example::

        The default values for the settings will be the ones specified in the
        environment file. Each task has its own copy of the settings.

        When invoked with multiple settings dictionaries, it is the
        responsibility of the custom UI to decide how to display the
        information. If you do not wish to implement the editing of multiple
        tasks at the same time, you can raise a ``NotImplementedError`` when
        there is more than one item in the list and the publisher will inform
        the user than only one task of that type can be edited at a time.
